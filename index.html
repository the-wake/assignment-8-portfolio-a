        <p class="about-me">Hello! I'm Ben Martin, an independent front-end web designer based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I specialize in creating highly usable, visually pleasing style (CSS) and practical, flexible, dynamic design (JavaScript).
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to web design and programming, I design board games. I have two published games and more in the works! In my free time, I enjoy playing Smash Bros. Ultimate (dirty Samus main) and Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition.
        <br />
        <br />
        For more information, check out my LinkedIn profile, or take a look at my GitHub page.</p>

                <a href="https://the-wake.github.io/project-1-dnd/"><h2>D&D Monster Finder</h2></a>
                <p>Every DM (Dungeon Master) knows that you can't build an encounter without monsters! Every DM also knows that as a system ages, tracking down monsters becomes a huge hassle.</p>
                <p>The D&D Monster Finder uses the open5e API to seach monsters from a huge range of official and unofficial sources. Users can select their desired Challenge Rating, browse mosters color-coded by type, and save lists of monsters they intend to use.</p>

                <a href="https://the-wake.github.io/assignment-6-weather/"><h2>Weather Dashboard</h2></a>
                <p>Have you ever wondered what the weather is like outside? Have you ever wondered what the weather is like somewhere else? Have you ever wanted to know what the weather will be like five days from now?</p>
                <p>If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, congratulations! This application can answer them for you! Drawing from the OpenWeather API, it will return the current conditions and 5-day forecast for any city you enter.</p>
